1. Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions 
   as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one 
   customer into this table.

	CREATE TABLE Multicust
	as
	SELECT * FROM SALESPEOPLE
	WHERE SNUM IN(SELECT SNUM FROM CUSTOMERS HAVING COUNT(CNUM)>1);



2. Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.
	
	 DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
	 WHERE CNUM NOT IN
	(SELECT CNUM FROM ORDERS);
	

3.Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all 
  salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.


	UPDATE SALESPEOPLE
	SET COMM=COMM+(COMM*0.20)
	WHERE SNUM=ANY
	(SELECT SNUM FROM ORDERS GROUP BY SNUM HAVING SUM(AMT)>3000);
