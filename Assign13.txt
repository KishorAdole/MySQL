1. Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, 
   and ratings of all customers. Those with rating of 200 or 
   greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

	SELECT cname, city, rating ,'High Rating'
	FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE RATING>=200
		UNION
	SELECT cname, city, rating, 'Low Rating'
	FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE RATING<200;

2.  Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and 
    each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical 
    order.

	SELECT SNAME, SNUM FROM SALESPEOPLE
		UNION
	SELECT CNAME, CNUM FROM CUSTOMER
	
	WHERE CNUM IN(SELECT CNUM FROM ORDERS
	GROUP BY CNUM HAVING COUNT(*)>1) ORDER BY SNAME;
	

3. Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in 
   San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the 
   onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries 
   but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first. 
   (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is 
   besides the point.)

	SELECT SNUM FROM SALESPEOPLE WHERE CITY='San Jose'
			UNION
	SELECT CNUM FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE CITY='San Jose'
			UNION
	SELECT ONUM FROM ORDERS WHERE ODATE='%%%%/10/03';
